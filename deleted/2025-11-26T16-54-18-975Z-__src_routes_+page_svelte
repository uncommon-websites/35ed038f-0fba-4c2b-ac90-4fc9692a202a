<Summary
	title="How it works"
	text="We connect urban millennials and Gen Z travelers with authentic local experiences through short-form video content from micro-creators who live in the city. Our community-driven vibe tagging system cuts through generic tourist recommendations, helping you discover cafes, bars, shops, and hidden gems that match your style. Think of it as your local insider, but for every city you visit."
